## üéÆ Key Features

### Game Modes
- **Single Player:** Challenge our adaptive AI opponent with three difficulty levels
- **Multiplayer:** Play locally with a friend on the same device

### Game Styles
- **Classic Mode:** Traditional Tic Tac Toe gameplay where the first to get three in a row wins
- **Limited Mode:** Each player can only have 3 pieces on the board at a time, creating a more dynamic and strategic experience

### AI Implementation
- **Easy Mode:** Makes mostly random moves with basic strategy
- **Medium Mode:** Balanced mix of random and strategic play
- **Hard Mode:** Adaptive learning AI that improves the more you play against it by recognizing and adapting to your strategies

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Animated SVG Game Pieces:** Smooth X and O animations with rounded strokes
- **Confetti Celebration:** Visual celebration when winning a game
- **Settings Modal:** View AI learning statistics and adjust game settings

### Persistence
- **Game Settings:** Your preferred difficulty level is remembered between sessions
- **AI Learning Data:** The AI's learned strategies persist across browser sessions

## üß† Technical Highlights

### Advanced AI Algorithms
The Hard mode AI incorporates multiple cutting-edge algorithms working in concert:

1. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
   - Simulates possible future game states to determine optimal moves
   - Uses UCB1 formula to balance exploration and exploitation
   - Provides forward-planning capabilities to the AI

2. **Bayesian Opponent Modeling**
   - Creates probabilistic models of player behavior
   - Tracks conditional probabilities of moves given board states
   - Normalizes board states to account for rotational symmetry
   - Predicts player's next moves based on observed patterns

3. **Multi-Armed Bandit Strategy Selection**
   - Treats different AI strategies as "arms" of a bandit
   - Uses Thompson sampling to dynamically select the most effective strategy
   - Continuously updates success rates based on game outcomes
   - Adapts to find the most effective approach against each player

4. **Persistent Learning Database**
   - Saves learning data between sessions using localStorage
   - Automatically saves periodically and when closing the browser
   - Maintains player pattern recognition across multiple play sessions

### Frontend Technologies
- **Framework:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 4
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Storage:** localStorage with versioning support
